## **Core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success:**

- **Dataiku’s core metrics related to the property claim market:**
  - Underwriting accuracy
  - Process optimization
  - Claim modeling
  - Reduction in manual processes

The only publicly available core metric I was able to source is how Dataiku's platform has helped AXA achieve these results.

**Real-World Example:**
One real-world example of Dataiku improving the insurance claims process comes from Frende Forsikring, a Norway Insurance company.

- Frende Forsikring implemented Dataiku process to sort and process claim emails.
- A Bert model was trained using around 10,000 emails to predict the correct unit routing for incoming emails. The precision of the model has correctly predicted 98-99% of the incoming emails and what claims unit the email should be routed to. This model is so accurate that if the AI disagrees with the claims unit it was originally sent to, it redirects the email to the correct claims unit. 

- This highly automated process has been estimated to save 56 work hours in February, 97 hours in March, and 74 work hours in April 2023, respectively.

# **Recommendations**

My main recommendations start with a focus on domain specific tokenization that will start the pipeline to NLP, a custom language model specific for the property claims market.  The company currently offers both services for use cases that are within the insurance space but not specifically targeted at the US property claims market.

I will use one segment in the property claim lifecycle and show how tokenization can positively impact this process and improve both NLP and contribute to a domain specific LM.

The claim lifecycle for a property claim in the US market starts with a claim being filed.

- **First Notice of Loss (FNOL)**
  - **The Claim Begins:** The insured notifies the insurance company about a property loss (damage, theft, etc.).
  - **Methods:** This can be done by phone, through an agent, or online form.
  - **Information Gathered:** Policy details, type and extent of damage, date of incident, contact information, etc.
  - The FNOL contains both PII (personally identifiable information) and unstructured data. Tokens can address both initially and continue throughout the claim lifecycle.
    - **Data Tokenization for Security:**
      - **Sensitive PII (personally identifiable information):** Replacing property addresses, owner names, policy details, etc., with unique, non-sensitive tokens (randomly generated identifiers).
      - **Purpose:** Protect personally identifiable information (PII) and payment data in line with privacy regulations.
      - **Example:** An address "123 Main St" might get a token like "AB45XY".
    - **NLP Tokenization for Text Analysis and unstructured data:**
      - **Breaking Down Text:** Segmenting insurance policies, claims descriptions, claim documents, and adjuster notes into meaningful units (words, phrases, or specialized insurance terms).
      - **Purpose:** Preparing text data for analysis by Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.
      - **Example:** A claim description would be tokenized into words, phrases, and potentially symbols like claim numbers.

In summary the application of tokens as it relates to the property insurance claims segment will help secure data that will let insurers collaborate with third parties and/or use cloud services with reduced risk of data breaches. Improved efficiency using NLP models in automating tasks, identify keywords and sentiment analysis. All of which will lead to efficiency gains and provide a key tools in detecting patterns and trends on both the macro and micro levels of the claims process.
